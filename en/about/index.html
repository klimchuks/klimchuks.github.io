              <p>Stepan Klimchuk was born and grew up in a small village in the Brest region, Belarus. Stepan's distinct artistic aesthetic was shaped early on by Belarusian folk art. The picturesque views of the Polesia swamps and surrounding landscapes inspire him to this day. Unique swamps and inundated oak forests of Polesia land is an object of European and world natural heritage. Stepan paint landscapes, florals and natural motifs, taking inspiration from the heritage of the original culture of Western Belarus and the glorious Polesia countryside. Stepan Klimchuk’s intensely worked paintings are characterized by an unusually fusion of drawing and color. The resulting paintings become dynamic, infused with light and energized by nature. There is a lot of airiness and space in the artworks, and that creates a feeling of cosmos.</p>
              <p>Stepan studied oil painting and graphics at The Belarusian State Academy of Arts (BSAA) in Minsk. During his studies he specialized in the field of book and easel graphics. In 1983 he graduated from the graphics department of the Belarusian State Theatre and Art Institute (now The Belarusian State Academy of Arts). Today the Academy is the most prominent higher education institution of arts in the Republic of Belarus and it has the status of a leading educational institution of the national system of art.</p>
              <p>Since 1988, for three years the artist has trained at the art workshops of the USSR Academy of Arts in Minsk. He studied under such renowned belarusian artists as a Mikhail Savitsky, Georgy Poplavsky and Vasily Sharangovich. As well the artist has participated in many republican and all-union art exhibitions since 1980. His artwork is represented in museums and galleries in Minsk, Borisov, Chelyabinsk, and has been purchased by the Belarusian Union of Artists.</p>
